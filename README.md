# Padding-adversarial-training (P-AT)
Here is the code (initial version) of paper "Padding Adversarial Training: Enhancing Robustness with Adversarial Space Hypothesis" (Under Review), which is a new adversarial defense method for improving DNNs' adversarial robustness.

We have verified P-AT with various models and datasets, here is the code of experiments in MNIST and CIFAR-10.

You can find out the training process and specific algorithm (loss function, padding generative function) in the python file with the prefix like train or Eval.

The specific parameter selection could be comprehended through our paper and the annotation in the training process python file.

If you have the requirements about specific model's pth file, please connect us at: ccsk1wsl@stu.xupt.edu.cn.
